        <h2 class="titledo">Decolonial Game Design</h2>

        <p class="space">During the Fall of 2024, I enrolled in a course titled “Decolonial Game Design,” not fully anticipating the profound impact it would have on my worldview. This class provided an in-depth exploration of the history of colonialism across the globe, including in the United States, and underscored how colonial legacies still permeate our daily lives. With each discussion and reading, I was challenged to question the origin of societal norms, power structures, and cultural practices that I once took for granted. Although it was often disheartening to uncover the breadth and depth of these colonial influences, it was an essential awakening—one that reinforced the importance of critically examining our shared history. The course pushed me to adopt a decolonial perspective not only in game design, but also in the way I perceive social, political, and cultural dynamics in everyday life.</p>
        
        <p class="space">A highlight of the class was the opportunity to create a decolonial game, which I titled <a href="https://patel6p5.itch.io/internatura-the-game">InterNatura</a>. Conceiving a game that grappled with such complex themes required me to synthesize the course material and critically engage with the ways in which our designs can both challenge and perpetuate colonial ideologies. This project was both intellectually stimulating and personally transformative, exemplifying the ethos of the class—game design as a medium for reflection, dialogue, and change. The picture below captures a moment from the final convention, where we played InterNatura in real time, offering a tangible culmination of everything we had learned about decolonial thinking, collaboration, and the power of creative expression.</p>
