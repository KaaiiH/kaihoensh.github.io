        <p class="space">I’m officially one month away from graduation, and it’s wild how quickly time can pass. I still remember complaining about COVID like it was just last year, but it’s been five already. People always say it goes by fast, but you never really believe it until you’re here, right at the finish line. It’s equal parts exciting and scary knowing how fast things will continue to fly by. But I’m so thankful for what UC, Honors, and Turner have given me: the chance to grow and leave here more enlightened than when I started.</p>

        <p class="space">Looking back, this journey has been nothing short of amazing. Sure, there are a bunch of things I could have done differently—maybe studied abroad, run for Senator at Large, or started a club. But at the end of the day, I’m content with the choices I made. Now, I’m eager to take this momentum and invest it back into my community through service. I feel like it’s the natural next step, to use what I’ve learned for something bigger than myself.</p>
    
        <p class="space">My worldview has definitely shifted, thanks in large part to two Honors classes I took over the past year: Decolonial Game Design in the Fall and The Human Condition in the Spring. Decolonial Game Design opened my eyes to so many hidden perspectives and truths about our world, and it was honestly overwhelming at first to process all of that. The Human Condition then gave me a sense of purpose and direction—like, what do I do with all these new insights? How can I leverage them to create understanding and build peace? Together, they really pushed me to grow and re-examine what I want to stand for.</p>
    
        <p class="space">I’ve changed so much since my first year that I bet my high school friends would barely recognize me now. But that’s exactly what I wanted out of college: real transformation. I can’t believe I’m so close to graduating, but I’m excited for what’s next. One month left to soak it all in—then it’s off to whatever awaits beyond these university walls.</p>
