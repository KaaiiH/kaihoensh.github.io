            Spring 2023
        </h1>
        <h2 class="titledo">Teaching Assistant for Engineering Education 1120</h2>

        <p class="space">Taking on the role of a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Engineering Education 1120 during the Spring of 2023 was a decision driven by my desire to support and encourage engineering students, especially women, to stay in the field. We need more women in STEM, and I wanted to do my part in fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for all students. This role provided me with a platform to directly influence the academic journey of many young engineers and to advocate for gender diversity in the field.</p>
        
        <p class="space">One of the most challenging aspects of this position was the unexpected amount of grading. Initially, I underestimated the volume of assignments and exams that needed to be evaluated. It was a grueling task, often taking up more time than I had anticipated. Despite the tedium of grading, it was a critical part of the job, ensuring that students received the feedback they needed to improve. Balancing this workload with my own studies required a great deal of time management and dedication.</p>

        <p class="space">However, the true joy of the role emerged through my interactions with the first-year engineering students during class sessions. These interactions were the highlights of my week, offering a break from the monotony of grading. Engaging with them, understanding their challenges, and providing support was incredibly fulfilling. I relished the opportunity to mentor these students, helping them navigate both academic and personal hurdles. Their enthusiasm and determination were contagious and inspiring.</p>

        <p class="space">Getting to know the first-year engineers and helping them navigate their initial year problems was a highlight of my experience. I found it deeply rewarding to offer reassurance that things would improve and to assist them with their coursework. The personal connections I made and the impact I had on their educational journey were the most gratifying parts of being a TA. It was fulfilling to see their progress and to know that I had played a small part in their success.</p>

        <p class="space">The picture below was taken during one of our optional study tables, where I helped students with their ENED homework and concepts. These sessions were not only an opportunity to provide academic support but also a chance to build a sense of community among the students. It was during these study tables that I was able to address individual questions and concerns, fostering a supportive learning environment. The informal setting encouraged open dialogue and made it easier for students to seek help.</p>
