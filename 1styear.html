        <h2 class="titledo">Year in Review</h2>
        
        <p class="space">Most of my first year can be summed up in a sentence.</p>
        <p class="space"><em>Unfortunately due to COVID it’s going to be virtual this year.</em></p>
        <p class="space">After asking students who are years ahead of me about their first year, they described it as an amazing time where they experienced some of the biggest most thought provoking changes in their life. For me personally my first year was… unique to say the least. My first year in college at the University of Cincinnati was an almost completely virtual experience. My biggest disappointment this year was hearing or reading the sentence above. If a club or activity I wanted to do wasn’t virtual, it was canceled. But enough about the struggle, I’d rather talk about growth.</p>
        <p class="space"> At the beginning this year I had a lot of fear. I just turned 19, I’m moving out of my mom’s house into a dorm at UC. Getting a fresh start, meeting new people, being in a new area. It was all a lot for me to take in since I’ve been in Columbus around the same people since I was born. Being the introverted geek that I am, the thought of having a roommate terrified me. I had fever dreams about roommates that would eat me in my sleep! Living with a stranger you roomed with on a whim is a gamble. About a month into my stay at Siddall Hall my roommate found out about my true nature, and we developed a mutually beneficial relationship where he would start and carry every conversation. I was never the best at making friends, but from all of the clubs I was in and being on campus I did end up making some good lasting friendships after finding my way around campus life.
        </p>
        <p class="space">While on campus I was excited for all of the opportunities (despite virtual circumstances) and hopped headfirst into the orgs! During the virtual Fall Org fair I signed up for about 13 clubs. I only ended up committing to 4 because the time overlaps, but I’m glad I was able to explore all of my interests! My favorite org on campus that I got involved in was the CEAS Tribunal where I got the opportunity to intern under the technology chair. This experience was the highlight of my first year! During this internship I made some nice friends in Tribunal and got to learn so much about front end development. Academically my first semester was smooth, since I was on campus I had access to all of the help centers and students as resources.
        </p>
        <p class="space">During my second semester I decided to stay at home instead of on campus since all of my classes were virtual anyway. And academically this made things way harder. When I was on campus college was my life; I lived, breathed, ate, and slept college. But when I stayed home while doing college I lost a lot of my drive to do coursework. I could tell it was mostly because I was way off campus and away from it all, but I don’t think working 20 hours a week helped much either. Despite these circumstances I felt as though I had a lot of growth the second semester. The highlight of my semester (besides my Tribunal internship) was the Gateway to Honors class. I learned a lot of life skills and about myself from this 1 credit hour course that I now use everyday, and it was by far my favorite class this year. Another highlight from this semester was when I received my position on the Undergraduate student government as Web Director. As part of my roadmap I made in Gateway to Honors I want to eventually become a Senator at Large in SG, but first becoming an exec is my first step towards that goal!
        </p>
        <p class="space">So how do I proceed? I have been thinking for the past couple weeks now. Now that I’m past all of the freshmen weed out classes, and I know what I want my major to be- it’s time to explore. Explore more ways my degree can be used, I first want to do this by getting a headstart at AI and machine learning over the summer. Explore more connections and opportunities on campus; I’m already on track to getting involved with SG, and more specifically I want to look into the international co-op program at UC. I’m also eager to get my GPA up from 3.4 to 3.6 by next spring!
        </p>
        <p class="space">The COVID-19 pandemic has been hard for everyone, some more than others. When it first hit the US everyone was scared, no one knew how to handle quarantines, lockdowns, and social distancing.  Most people wouldn’t go to college if it’s all going to be virtual because of how the classes operate, and the lack of social interaction. I know this personally because the majority of my friends from high school decided to take a gap year. But personally I knew that I had to go to college right after highschool despite the pandemic because if I didn’t then, I never would. I’d fall into the trap most of my family fell into, and I probably would’ve got a factory job.  Regardless of the circumstances, I made it and I’m here! Given the pandemic is now winding down I hope to get more on-campus action the upcoming year
