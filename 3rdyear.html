        <p class="space"> My third year in college was the most memorable so far! I started this year but an extravagant summer in Louiville during my second rotation at GE Appliances. I got to get out of the house a lot and explore a new city I've never lived in before. I made some good friends and had some good memories over the summer, while also learning more about the software engineering industry. Just like the last rotation, about the time I got use to the work culture and what we were working on my rotation was over.

        <p class="space"> My first semester back to UC, I jumped right back into school taking 16 credit hours. Over the course of the semester I struggled a lot with my CS classes, the most challenging being Computer Networks. But my Honors English class served as a light in the dark for my semester. Every class in Honors English allowed me to collaborate with like-minded peers, engage in spirited discussions, and challenge and support other people's perspective. Compared to all of my other classes this class served as artistic break from all of the STEM in my other classes. Beyond the class, English inspired me to start writing poetry again. Something I've been struggling to get into ever since COVID and I started college.

        <p class="space"> During the Fall semester and the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about my future and what I wanted to do while in college, as well as what I wanted to be doing after college. This lead me to reconsider my particpation in ICP (International Co-op Program), and think more about what would make me happy. I made the decision that I should focus and narrow down exactly what I want to do before I commit myself to going abroad, even if I lose that opportunity. In the Fall it was also during the Fall that I struggled to find another Co-op opportunity that had more to do with web development, which is something I've wanted to try out and possibly go into with my CS degree.
        </p>
        <p class="space"> Unable to find a Co-op for the Spring semester I decided to take another academic year in the spring. It was also in the Spring that I decided to become a TA for Engineering Education! After one of my mentees dropped out of Engineering because they failed ENED, I thought I would try to help other 1st year engineering students avoid that fate by helping them as much as I could as a TA. Being a TA also helped my financial plight of missing a co-op rotation, along with being a TA I picked up a part time job as a waiter as a restraunt.
        </p>
        <p class="space">A lot of my time during the Spring was spent applying to internships, working, or doing classwork. Since I had all of these other responsibilities on my plate I only took 12 credit hours this semester to focus on myself and my future. I'm still at a crossroads on where I want to go. In the spring I initially though I wanted to go abroad, then I thought I wanted to get an MBA, but now I'm of the mindset that I want to get a certification in animiation. Either way I'm not stressed out, I'm greatful to being in a position to be able to consider all of these options.
        </p>
        <p class="space"> Although my 3rd year at UC was filled with amazing experiences, I definetly hit a slump. I've struggled dealing with my future, what I want to do, and was and still am very indecisive about it. Compared to my last two years I explored new avenues of campus, I strayed further away from tribunal and student government, and more into academia and myself. This year has enabled me to change my roadmap to help me live my truth.
